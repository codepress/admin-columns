= Enhanced list tables =
By default, WordPress provides list tables, giving you an overview of your content in the admin panel. These list tables are quite limited, however. For posts and custom post types, for example, not much more than the date and title of the post is displayed. Admin Columns allows you to take control over these list tables, managing the columns dislpayed in these overviews. Supporting custom fields, featured images, custom taxonomies, EXIF data for media and much, much more (Admin Columns features over 200 columns), you can create overviews that are perfectly suited for your content.

= Features =
Admin Columns greatly enhances your WordPress installation. Whether you're running a simple blog or a full-blown enterprise website, it will prove its worth within minutes. Thanks to our dedicated development and support team, you can rest assured that Admin Columns will persist to be an essential part of any WordPress installation.

To give you some insight into the great amount of possibilities Admin Columns offers to enhance your (or your client's) WordPress admin panel, be sure to check out the screenshots or the demo video!

= Sortable, filterable and editable columns & import/export =
All of the new columns support sorting on all screens, and many of them support filtering. Another great feature is direct editing: it allows you to directly edit all types of data (including titles, featured images, custom fields and taxonomies) directly from the posts overview. These features are only available with [Admin Columns Pro](https://www.admincolumns.com)! Admin Columns Pro also allows you to import and export your column setup, and it allows you to save your columns to PHP, so you (and your clients) don't have to worry about the admin interface!

= Third party plugin integration =
Admin Columns works perfectly with just about all external plugins with custom columns. Examples include Yoast SEO (SEO columns), WooCommerce, Advanced Custom Fields, Types and Pods. Not only can you reorganize the custom columns added by these plugins, you can also add custom columns provided by Admin Columns in the overview!

The Developer license of [Admin Columns Pro](https://www.admincolumns.com/admin-columns-pro/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=thirdpartyplugins) includes [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.admincolumns.com/advanced-custom-fields/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=thirdpartyplugins) and [WooCommerce](https://www.admincolumns.com/woocommerce-columns/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=thirdpartyplugins) add-ons for easy integration and inline editing of data from these plugins.

= Custom field column =
Admin Columns allows you to display custom fields for posts (post meta) and users (user meta) for all custom fields you have. With many different custom field types supported, such as files, images, numbers and even post and user relations, you can create a beautiful overview of your custom content!

To ensure proper formatting of your custom fields, Admin Columns provides a set of custom field types, which automatically format your meta data properly.
