== Description ==

This plugin makes it easy to Manage Custom Columns for your Posts, Pages and Custom Post Type Screens. 

= Intro = 

This plugin let's you visually customize the Admin Columns. You can add or remove columns, change their label and reorder them.

= Custom Columns =

The following custom columns are supported:

* Featured Image
* Excerpt
* Post Attachments
* Page Order
* Page Templates
* Post Formats
* Taxonomies
* ID
* Slug
* Word count
* Sticky
* Custom Fields

= Custom Fields =

With the custom field column you can display custom field values. It will show the value as a default. You can also set your own type:

* Image thumbnails
* Icons for Media Library items
* Excerpt
* Multiple Values
* Numeric

= Sortable Custom Columns =

A nice feature is that it will make some of the new columns support sorting. By default WordPress let's you sort by Title, Date, Comments and Author. This will make you be able to sort by:

* ID
* page order
* slug 
* page template
* custom fields

= User Columns =

You can also change the User Columns. I have added a few additional custom columns:

* User ID
* First name
* Last name
* Url
* Register date

I will be adding more in coming releases. You can leave any <a href='http://www.codepress.nl/plugins/codepress-admin-columns#feedback'>requests or feedback</a>.
